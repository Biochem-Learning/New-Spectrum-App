We know that it is normal to see a very small peak (called the M+1 peak) with a mass one greater than the molecular weight due to isotopes of carbon and hydrogen. Since the M+1 peak should be very small, we know that the signal at 45 can't be for the molecular weight because the peak at 46 is too large to be from isotopes. So 46 must be the molecular ion peak and 45 must be from loss of a hydrogen." },

We interpret the signals like this: There is a signal at about 3.4 ppm that is a quartet with a relative integration of 2 hydrogens. Lets break down all of the information in this peak. First the chemical shift. Signals in this general region of the spectrum tend to be due to hydrogens bonded to carbons next to oxygens (O-C-H). The integration tells us that there are two hydrogens in this group so it is probably a CH2. Finally, the quartet of peaks tells us the neighboring carbon has 3 hydrogens bonded to it. All together this tells us the molecule contains an O-CH2-CH3 piece. Click to display the fragment table then click on this piece. Similarly, the signal at about 1.1 ppm tells us there is a CH3 (integration of 3H) next to a CH2 (three peaks in the signal). This fits with the signal at about 3.4 ppm.",
